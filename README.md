# Portfolio
This is the week 2 challenge project from coding bootcamp @ Washington University 

The goal was to create a personal portfolio webpage to represent our work

The design criteria required that there be a nav bar which contains links to the sections of the page. 
A profile picture. Sections containing an About Me, Skills and Education, a project showcase which has image tiles representing the projects that link to the deployed webpage of the projects when clicked. The first project image must be larger than the following project images. There must be a contact section that links to the appropriate contact information when the links are clicked. The website must be responsive across multiple platforms and display adequately on mobile devices.

As a coloblind person, I elected for a simple black and white look that is reminiscent of a terminal. As a new developer, I am still learning about design  concepts and need to spend much more time studying the principles of graphic design and reviewing websites and advertising layouts to grow my skills. I elected for a simple layout to practice refining my HTML and CSS/Flexbox skills. I used flex properties and relative values to make a responsive design free of breakpoints that would necessitate multiple different layouts. 

As I progress in my coding journey, developing and refining my skills, this page will be continuously revisted and improved. Currently, there are placeholders in the page for future projects and a blank document inserted where my resume will eventually live. I made active links in the code which will allow them to be easily updated with the appropriate image files and hyperlinks once available.
